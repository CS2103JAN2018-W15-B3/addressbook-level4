== PROJECT: Fastis - MeetUp Manager

---

== Overview

Fastis is a desktop application that aims to help students who are studying at National University of Singapore (NUS) manage their group projects effectively. The application enables students to keep track of group membersâ€™ timetables, information, meetups agendas, to-dos and schedule suitable meetup time.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *group* feature
** What it does: It allows users to create a group class, which allows users to add members to the group, list them out and delete the group.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of members of a certain group project , which allows him to find the person of contact quickly and more easily. It also helps users to better manage members of his group project.
** Highlights: This enhancement adds many new commands to make the application more convenient for the users to organise their groups. It required an in-depth analysis of model and logic component. The implementation too was challenging as it required adding new commands and required understanding of the model to implement the group features.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added command to list members of the same tags.
* *Minor enhancement*: Added a status foot bar showing number of members in Fastis.
* *Minor enhancement*: Added colours to the tags belonging to members in Fastis.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main/tree/master/collated/functional/jas5469.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/jas5469.md[Test code]]

// tag::listTag[]
=== List Tag Members: `listTagMembers`

List out all persons with the given keywords(group tags). +
Alias: `ltm` +
Format: `listTagMembers INPUT`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `cs1010` will match `CS1010`
* Only the name is searched.
****

Examples:

* `listTagMembers CS3230 CS1010` +
Returns any person having group tags `CS3230`, `CS1010`
Refer to Figure 4 for example.

//tag:ListTagMembers[]
=== List Tag Members Feature

Fastis lists all persons in Fastis that have tags similar to input.

==== Current Implementation
Fastis uses `ListTagMembersCommand` ,which resides under `Logic` to facilitate the listing of members under the same
tag.

image:listGroupMemberSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"] +
When user types in command line `ListTagMembers` or `ltm` , Fastis will use the keyword provided to search for the
tag and list out all members under the same  tag.

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a command to list out the group members.
** Pros: Easy to change the methods called by command.
** Cons: Unable to link to group class.
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `ListTagMembersCommand(`
** Pros: Edit `ListTagMembersCommand()` easily to suit our needs
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

//end:ListTagMembers[]

// tag::addGroup[]
=== Add Group feature

Fastis adds a group named by the user from input.

==== Current Implementation

The add groups mechanism is facilitated by `AddGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports adding Group objects to the address book. AddGroupCommand inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, AddGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

The groups in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `Information` object, representing the information of the group.
Address book stores all groups in `UniqueGroupList`.
`Group`,`Information` and `UniqueGroupList` class reside inside `Model` component. The following is the class diagram showing the relationship between `Group` and `Information`:

image:GroupInformationClassDiagram.png[width ="800"]

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UniqueGroupList` in the address book will be empty if no groups have been added before.

The user executes a new `AddGroupCommand` with `Information`, to add a new group to the address book.
The new group is added to the `UniqueGroupList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
The following sequence diagram shows how the addGroup operation works:

image:AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `AddGroupCommand()`
** Pros: It is easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `executeAddGroupCommand()`
** Pros: It is not able to lose any addGroup functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `AddGroupCommand` do not have to know that `executeAddGroupCommand()` exist.
** Cons: It is hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

// end::addGroup[]
// tag::addMembersToGroup[]
=== Add Member To Group feature

Fastis adds a person from the existing contact list to an existing group.

==== Current Implementation

The add members to groups mechanism is facilitated by `AddMembersToGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports adding a member to Group objects to the address book.

The list of members in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `UniquePersonList` object, representing the list of persons in the group.
Address book stores all members added to the group using XmlAdaptedPersons as person object storage.
The following sequence diagram shows how the addMembersToGroup operates.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddMembersToGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `AddMembersToGroupCommand()`
** Pros: It is easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want

// end:addMembersToGroup[]

// tag::deleteGroup[]
=== Delete Group feature

Fastis deletes a group named by the user from input.

==== Current Implementation

The delete groups mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports deleting Group objects to the address book. AddGroupCommand inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

The groups in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `Information` object, representing the information of the group.
Address book stores all groups in `UniqueGroupList`.
`Group`,`Information` and `UniqueGroupList` class reside inside `Model` component. The following is the class diagram showing the relationship between `Group` and `Information`:

image:GroupInformationClassDiagram.png[width ="800"]

The user executes a new `DeleteGroupCommand` with `Information`, to delete a existing group with the same information to the address book.
The new group is deleted from the `UniqueGroupList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
The following sequence diagram shows how the deleteGroup operation works:
