By: `Team W15-B3`      Since: `February 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction
image:FASTIS.png[width="500"] +
Fastis is a desktop application which functions as an address book that aims to help students who are studying at National University of Singapore (NUS) manage their group projects effectively. The application enables students to keep track of group members’ timetables, information, meetups agendas, to-dos, and schedule suitable meetup time.

This Developer Guide is meant to provide the necessary information for developers who are interested in contributing to this application. The guide consists of the set-up steps to develop the application and the detailed descriptions and implementations of the application’s current features.

This can help developers understand the implementation of the features and able to modify any feature for further improvements.

[NOTE]
Address book in the developer guide refers to Fastis.

== Setting up
The following steps will guide you on the set up of FASTIS.

=== Prerequisites

The following programs have to be installed on the computer system.

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-W15-B3/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram.
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other during application launch.
* Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary during shut down.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

<<Design-Database,*`Database`*>> handles the downloading of module information via the https://github.com/nusmodifications/nusmods/tree/master/api/data[NUSmods API], as well as holding and retrieving the information. Because it is only accessed and never changed, the database component resides on its own outside of the `Model` component.

The rest of the App consists of these components:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The holder of the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The location on the hard disk where date is read from and written to.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component.
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1).
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2).
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component.
image::UiClassDiagramV1.5.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `ToDoListPanel`, `GroupListPanel`, `Calendar`, `TimeTable`, `StatusBarFooter`. All these, including the `MainWindow` and excluding  `ProgessIndicatorProperty`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. +

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component.
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  The `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command.
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component.
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`component,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component.
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

//tag::Database[]
[[Design-Database]]
=== Database component

.Structure of the Database Component.
image::DatabaseClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `Database` component:

* downloads module information from the `NUSmods API`.
* retrieves modules given a NUSmods timetable link.

[NOTE]
NUSmods timetable links are the sharable short URL from a NUSmods page.
E.g. http://modsn.us/MYwiD

//end::Database[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Execution of delete command.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.Push of delete command into undoStack.
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

.Execution of Adding David.
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

.State before the add command restored.
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence diagram for Undo/Redo.
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Execution of clear command.
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.Execution of list command, which will not be added to undoStack after execution.
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Activity diagram of undo/redo.
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

//tag::ModuleDatabase[]
=== Module database feature
==== Current implementation

The database feature enables Fastis to store and quickly find lesson schedules. Fastis uses the available `NUSmods API` to retrieve module information from the API server.

The sequence diagram for the instantiation of DatabaseManager is shown below.

image::DatabaseComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

On startup, the network component makes a connection to the API server and checks the `lastmodified` field of the `JSON` file on the server. If the `lastmodified` date is more recent that the `JSON` file held in storage, the network component will download and overwrite the existing file on disk.

The `Storage` component then converts the JSON file into a hashMap of modules to be held in the `Database` component.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of Module information

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store a complete dataset of all modules
** Pros: Storing a complete database allows Fastis to access information when used offline.
** Cons: Storing a complete database requires more memory space.
* **Alternative 2:** Store nothing, retrieve only module information of single module each time.
** Pros: Not storing anything means no storage space is needed.
** Cons: Not storing anything requires Fastis to constantly download information from the web, making the app reliant on good internet connection.

// end::ModuleDatabase[]

//tag::Calendar[]
=== Calendar Feature
Fastis uses a stand-alone `Calendar` class, adapted from https://github.com/SirGoose3432/javafx-calendar[javafx-calendar] by SirGoose3432.
It is used to view the user's upcoming events, e.g. interviews, meetings, etc.

==== Current implementation

The calendar feature is facilitated by `Calendar` and `CalendarDate` classes,
both of which reside inside `Ui` component. Their sole purpose is to draw out the calendar
in the application when given a list of `Event` objects.

The calendar is drawn/redrawn whenever a `CalendarChangedEvent` is raised.
The flow of operation thereafter is shown the sequence diagram below.

image::CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

`Calendar` utilizes the `Event` class to determine which slots in the schedule are occupied.
Hence, a list of events is passed to every calendar upon construction and saved as a private variable.

The details of these event, e.g. time, location, are saved locally in `.xml` file format.
It is also retrieved upon start up by the `Storage` component and saved within the `Model` for the whole process.

The implementation of `Calendar` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public Calendar(ObservableList<Event> eventList) {
    super(FXML);
    // ... Assigning class fields ...
    initCalendar();
    registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
}

private void initCalendar() {
    // ... Create the calendar 7x6 GridPane ...
    // ... Construct 42 CalendarDate objects ...
    fillCalendar(currentYearMonth);
    showEvents();
    // ... show CalendarView ...
}

private void fillCalendar(YearMonth yearMonth) {
    // ... Fill the calendar with the correct dates according to yearMonth ...
}

private void showEvents() {
    // ... Show all events that are in the current yearMonth in the eventList ...
}
----

The current time is retrieved upon startup, and the calendar base on that point in time to display the appropriate time frame.

==== Design Considerations
[[calendarImplementation]]
===== Aspect: Implementation of the `Calendar`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a stand-alone `Calendar` class
** Pros:
*** Easy to manipulate data.
*** Easy to customize appearance.
** Cons:
*** Likely not optimized implementation.
*** Might not be aesthetically pleasing.
* **Alternative 2:** Import external libraries/API
** Choices:
*** https://developers.google.com/calendar/[Google Calendar API]
*** https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[CalendarFX]
** Pros:
*** Likely optimized algorithms.
*** Aesthetically pleasing.
** Cons:
*** Restricted to what the libraries/API offer.
*** Need a firm understanding of the whole API to implement well.

===== Aspect: Storing of the `eventList`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the `eventList` within the `Calendar` object.
** Pros: Easy to show events and their details, even after the constructor returns.
** Cons: Takes up some redundant memory if there are no commands for showing these events.
* **Alternative 2:** Only passes the `eventList` as a parameter to the constructor and not storing it as a field within the `Calendar` object.
** Pros: Codes are less cluttered and less memory is used.
** Cons: Hard to show events and their details outside of the constructor.
// end::Calendar[]

//tag::Timetable[]
[[Timetable]]
=== Timetable feature
Fastis uses a stand-alone `Timetable` class, based largely on the `Calendar` class. It is used to view the user's own NUSMods timetable as well as that of other people in his address book.

==== Current implementation

The timetable is the weekly equivalent to the monthly Calendar.
This feature is similarly facilitated by the analogous `Timetable` and `TimetableSlot` classes,
both of which reside inside `Ui` component. Their sole purpose is to draw out the timetable
in the application when given a list of `WeeklyEvent` objects.

The calendar is drawn/redrawn whenever a `TimetableChangedEvent` is raised.
This is done either by a precedent `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` or a `ScheduleGroupCommand`.
The flow of operation thereafter is shown the sequence diagram below.

image::TimetableSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The implementation of `Timetable` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public Timetable(ObservableList<WeeklyEvent> eventList) {
    super(FXML);
    // ... Assigning class fields ...
    initTimetable();
    registerAsAnEventHandler(this);
}

private void initTimetable() {
    // ... Create the calendar 6x11 GridPane ...
    // ... Construct 66 TimetableSlot objects ...
    clearTimetable();
    showSlots();
    // ... show TimetableView ...
}

private void clearTimetable() {
    // ... Draw all slots as blank ...
    // ... Draw the timeline on the left ...
}

private void showSlots() {
    // ... Show all slots that are in the in the eventList ...
    // ... Make sure no 2 modules with different name would have the same color ...
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of the `Timetable` and Storing of the `eventList`
As the weekly equivalent of `Calendar`, `Timetable` has the same aspect to consider. See <<calendarImplementation, Implementation of the Calendar>>.

===== Aspect: Supporting modules on weekends and/or after 6pm
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Don't support showing those modules
** Pros: Make the GUI less cluttered and more readable
** Cons:
*** Cannot cater to users with those modules in their timetable
*** Cannot schedule meetings on the weekends
* **Alternative 2:** Support showing those modules
** Pros: Catering to users with those modules, and support scheduling for the weekends.
** Cons: As the GUI already have 2 other main components which are the PersonListPanel and TodoListPanel, adding more columns to the Timetable makes it looks cluttered.
// end::Timetable[]

//tag::showingTimetable[]
[[showingTimetable]]
=== Showing the Timetable feature
==== Current implementation
When a person is selected, either by the `select` command or by mouse click via the GUI, a `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is raised. The flow of operation thereafter is shown the sequence diagram below.

image::nusModsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Upon receiving the event, the `UI` component takes the `Person` within the `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` and calls the `parseEvents()` method of `DataBaseManager`, passing the `TimetableLink` of the `Person` as an argument.

The result of the `parseEvents()` is an `ArrayList` of `WeeklyEvents`. This result is used to form a `TimeTableChangedEvent`, which ultimately tells the `UI` component to display the result.

The implementation of `parseEvents()` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public static ArrayList<WeeklyEvent> parseEvents(TimeTableLink link) {
        ArrayList<WeeklyEvent> eventList = new ArrayList<>();

        if (!isCurrentSem(link)) {
           // ... display and log warning messages ...
        }

        String query = getQuery(link);

       // ... parse query into WeeklyEvents ...

        return eventList;
    }
----

The `parseEvents()` method firsts checks if the `TimetableLink` points to a schedule that is in the same semester as Fatis' database. It then calls the `getQuery` helper method, which a `URLconnection` to the shortened URL in `TimetableLink` and returns the `query` part of the full-length URL.

The method then takes the `query` and parses them into modules and lessons, which are used to form `WeeklyEvents`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of a person's schedule

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store only the link to a NUSmods page for each person
** Pros: Storing only the link requires very little space. The schedule of a person can easily be changed by editing the `TimetableLink`.
** Cons: Storing only the link requires Fastis to make a connection to the web each time a person is selected.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the schedule of each person in the `AddressBook`
** Pros: Storing every person's schedule will require much more space, and there will be a dilemma between whether to store it as `WeeklyEvent`, or `Module` and `schedule`
** Cons: Storing ever person's schedule requires Fastis to make a connection to the web only when a person is added or edited.

//end::showingTimetable[]

//tag::Scheduling[]
[[Scheduling]]
=== Scheduling meetings feature
Fastis supports showing all the common free time slots for all members in based on their timetable.

==== Current implementation
Fastis utilizes a few components to schedule the meetings, namely the `Group` class and `WeeklyEvent` class in `Model`, `Timetable` in `UI`, and `parseEvents()` in `Database`.
The command to show the scheduled meetings is `ScheduleGroupCommand`, which resides in `Logic` component.

When a `ScheduleGroupCommand` is executed, it first gets all group members from `Model`.
For each member, it parses the `TimetableLink` to get all of his/her modules, and add them to an `occupied` list.
From that list, the command generates all free time slots in another list called `free`, and post that event to be handled by the `UI` component later.

The flow of operation is shown the sequence diagram below.

image::ScheduleGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The implementation of `ScheduleGroupCommand` is as follows:

[source,java]
----
public ScheduleGroupCommand(Group group) {
    requireNonNull(group);
    // ... Assigning class fields ...
    EventsCenter.getInstance().registerHandler(this);
}

public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    // ... Get the group's member from Model ...
    fillTimeSlots(group);
    generateFreeTimeSlots();
    // ... Post new TimetableChangedEvent ...
    // ... Return new CommandResult ...
}

private void fillTimeSlots(Group group) {
    for (Person member : group.getPersonList()) {
        // ... Parse the TimetableLink into moduleList
        // ... Add all modules in moduleList to occupied list
    }
}

private void generateFreeTimeSlots() {
    // ... Generate free time slots logic
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Scheduling algorithm
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show all free time slots
** Pros: Intuitive for users, and easy to read.
** Cons: Slow, as there are a few extra steps to process.
* **Alternative 2:** Show all occupied time slots
** Pros: Very fast.
** Cons:
*** Could become cluttered as there are normally more occupied slots than free slots.
*** Not intuitive for users.
// end::Scheduling[]

// tag::listTagMembers[]
=== List Tag Members Feature

Fastis lists all persons in Fastis that have tags similar to input.

==== Current implementation
Fastis uses `ListTagMembersCommand` ,which resides under `Logic` to facilitate the listing of members under the same
tag.

.Sequence diagram of list tag members command
image:listTagMemberSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"] +
When user types in command line `ListTagMembers` or `lTM` , Fastis will use the keyword provided to search for the
tag and list out all members under the same  tag.

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a command to list out the members with same tag.
** Pros: It is easy to change the methods called by command.
** Cons: Unable to link to group class.
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `ListTagMembersCommand()`.
** Pros: It is easy to follow the abstract method to implement essential methods in `ListTagMembersCommand()`.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

// end::listTagMembers[]

// tag::addGroup[]
[[Group]]
=== Add Group feature

Fastis has a group feature that can:

* add a group with information that was stated by user input.
* delete a group with information that was stated  by user input.
* add a person into the group with information that was stated by user input.
* delete a person from the group with information that was stated by user input.
* list all the members in the group with information that was stated by user input.


==== Current implementation

The group mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueGroupList`, which resides inside `Model` component. Address book stores all groups in `UniqueGroupList`.
The groups in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `Information` object, representing the information of the group.
`Group`,`Information` and `UniqueGroupList` class reside inside `Model` component. The following is the class diagram showing the relationship between `Group`, `Information` and `UniqueGroupList`:

.Group Class Diagram.
image:GroupClassDiagram.png[width ="800"]

The following diagram is a object diagram of Group Class.

.Object Diagram of `Group`.
image:GroupObjectDiagram.png[width="600"]

Suppose that the user has just launched the application . The `UniqueGroupList` in the address book will include few groups that are declared in SampleDataUtil.

A Group consists of the following:

* Information: Represents the information of the group.
* PersonList: Represents the list of persons in a group.

The add group feature adds a group with information named by user in input into Fastis.


The add group mechanism is facilitated by `AddGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports adding `Group` object to the address book. `AddGroupCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, `AddGroupCommand` can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the `AddGroupCommand` that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... AddGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The following diagram shows the interaction of `AddGroup` Command class.
.Class Diagram of add group Command.
image:AddGroupCommandClassDiagram.png[width:"600"]

The user executes a new `AddGroupCommand` with `Information`, to add a new group to the address book.
The new group is added to the `UniqueGroupList` and the current state of the address book is saved.

The `AddGroupCommand` is facilitated by `AddGroupCommandParser` to parse `AddGroupCommand`.
The following diagram shows the flow of parsing of `AddGroupCommand` object.

.Sequence Diagram for AddGroupParser.
image:AddGroupParserSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the add group operation works:

.AddGroup Sequence Diagram.
image:AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `AddGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `AddGroupCommand()`
** Pros: It is easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `executeAddGroupCommand()`
** Pros: It is not able to lose any addGroup functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `AddGroupCommand` do not have to know that `executeAddGroupCommand()` exist.
** Cons: It is hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

=== Add Member To Group feature

Fastis adds a person from the existing contact list to an existing group.

==== Current implementation

The add member to group mechanism is facilitated by `AddMemberToGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports adding a member to `Group` objects to the address book. `AddMemberToGroupCommand` inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, AddMemberToGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddMemberToGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... AddMemberToGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The list of members in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `UniquePersonList` object, representing the list of persons in the group.
Address book stores all members added to the group using XmlAdaptedPersons as person object storage as shown in  the following sequence diagram where  the storage saves to file in XmlAdaptedGroups.
Fastis will then handle `addressBookChangedEvent` and update command result.

The following diagram shows the interaction of `AddMemberToGroup` Command class.
.Class Diagram of AddMemberToGroup Command.

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `AddMemberToGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `AddMemberToGroupCommand()`.
** Pros: It is easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want.
** Cons: There are  more commands required to be remembered.
* **Alternative 2 :** Add a new interface `EditGroupMemberCommand()` to handle adding members to group.
** Pros: It is not required to create a new command.
** Cons: It is less flexible.

=== Delete Member From Group feature

Fastis deletes a person from the existing contact list to an existing group.

==== Current implementation

The delete member from groups mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports deleting a member to Group objects to the address book. `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand` from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... DeleteMemberFromGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The list of members in the group list are facilitated by `Group` class. Each `Group` object have a `UniquePersonList` object, representing the list of persons in the group.
Address book stores all members added to the group using XmlAdaptedPersons as person object storage.
The `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand` will retrieve the input, which is the index of the person of the last updated person list, and deletes that person from the list if the person exists in the `UniquePersonList` in the specified group.
Fastis will then handle `addressBookChangedEvent` and update command result.

The following diagram shows the interaction of `DeleteMemberFromGroup` Command class.
.Class Diagram of `DeleteMemberFromGroup` Command.

==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `DeleteMemberToGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `DeleteMemberFromGroupCommand()`
** Pros: It is easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want.
** Cons: There are more commands that are required to be remembered by users and developers.
* **Alternative 2 :** Add a new interface `EditGroupMemberCommand()`.
** Pros: It is not required to create a new command.
** Cons: It is less flexible.

=== List Group Members Feature

Fastis lists all persons under the group keyed by user.

==== Current implementation

Fastis uses `ListGroupMembersCommand` ,which resides under `Logic` to facilitate the listing of members under the same
group.

When user types in command line lListGroupMembers` or `lGM` , Fastis will use the keyword provided to search for the
group and list out all members under the specified group in the `PersonListPanel`.

The `ListGroupMembersCommand` is facilitated by `ListGroupMembersCommandParser` to parse `ListGroupMembersCommand`.
The following diagram shows the flow of parsing of `ListGroupMembersCommand` object.

.Sequence diagram for ListGroupMemberCommandParser.

image:lGMSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Implementation of `ListGroupMembersCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a command to list out the members with same group.
** Pros: Easy to change the methods called by command.
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `ListGroupMembersCommand(`
** Pros: Edit `ListGroupMembersCommand()` easily to suit our needs
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

=== Delete Group Feature

Fastis deletes a group named by the user from input.

==== Current implementation

The delete groups mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteGroupCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports deleting Group objects to the address book. DeleteGroupCommand inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteGroupCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the DeleteGroupCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteGroupCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... DeleteGroup logic ...
    }
}
----

The user executes a new `DeleteGroupCommand` with `Information`, to delete a existing group with the same information to the address book.
The group is deleted from the `UniqueGroupList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
Fastis will then handle `addressBookChangedEvent` and update command result.

The following diagram shows the interaction of `DeleteGroup` Command class.
.Class Diagram of `DeleteGroup` Command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `DeleteGroupCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command method `deleteGroupCommand()`
** Pros: It is easy for developers to modify method to suit what they want
* **Alternative 2:** Add a new abstract method `executeDeleteGroupCommand()`
** Pros: It is not able to lose any deleteGroup functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `DeleteGroupCommand` do not have to know that `executeDeleteGroupCommand()` exist.
** Cons: It is hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.

// end::addGroup[]

// tag::ChangeTagColor[]
=== Tag Color feature
Fastis supports changing the color of the tags given to people in the address book. There are up to 17 colors to choose from.

==== Current implementation

Changing a tag's color is facilitated by `ChangeTagColorCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component.
It supports modifying the `color` field within `Tag` objects.

The flow of operation is shown the sequence diagram below.

image::ChangeTagColorSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

`ChangeTagColorCommand` inherit from `UndoableCommand`, therefore it can be undone and redone using `UndoRedoStack`.

The implementation of `ScheduleGroupCommand` is as follows:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class ChangeTagColorCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        // .. Get the tag's name and color from Model
    }

    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... Update tag in Model ...
        // ... Update Person list in Model ...
        // ... Return new CommandResult ...
    }
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Different tags with the same color

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow
** Pros:
*** Users have more freedom.
*** Code is shorter.
** Cons: Might result in aesthetically unpleasing GUI
* **Alternative 2:** Disallow
** Pros:
*** More intuitive.
*** Ensure aesthetic values for GUI.
** Cons: Code is longer.
// end::ChangeTagColor[]

// tag::addToDo[]
=== Add ToDo feature
==== Current implementation

The add to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `AddToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports adding ToDo objects to the address book. AddToDoCommand inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, AddToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.
With the extra layer, the AddToDoCommand that is undoable is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class AddToDoCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... add to-do logic ...
    }
}
----

The to-dos in the to-do list are facilitated by `ToDo` class. Each `ToDo` object have a `Content` object and a `Status` object, representing the content and status of the to-do.
Address book stores all to-dos in `UniqueToDoList`.
`ToDo`,`Content` and `UniqueToDoList` class reside inside `AddressBook`. <<fig43,Figure 43>> is the class diagram showing the relationship between `ToDo`,`Content`, `Status`, `UniqueToDoList` and `AddressBook`:
[[fig43]]
.Class Diagram for UniqueToDoList.
image::AddressBookUniqueToDoListToDoClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

On a smaller scale, <<fig44, Figure 44>> is a class diagram showing the relationship between `ToDo`,`Content` and `Status`:

[[fig44]]
.Class Diagram for To-Do.
image::ToDoStatusContentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UniqueToDoList` in the address book will be empty if no to-dos have been added previously.

The user executes a new `AddToDoCommand` with `Content`, to add a new to-do to the address book.
The `Status` of the to-do is "undone" by default.
The new to-do with content and status is added to the `UniqueToDoList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
<<fig45, Figure 45>> shows how the addToDo operation works:

[[fig45]]
.Sequence Diagram for addToDo.
image::AddToDoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddToDoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Restrict the constructor of ToDo to be ToDo(Content content, Status status)`
** Pros: This implementation allows ToDo class to be easier to maintain and debug.
** Cons: This implementation requires extensive refactor of existing tests.
// end::addToDo[]

// tag::checkToDo[]
=== Check/UnCheck ToDo feature
==== Current implementation

The check/uncheck to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `CheckToDoCommand` and `UnCheckToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports modifying Status objects within ToDo objects. CheckToDoCommand and UnCheckToDoCommand inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, CheckToDoCommand and UnCheckToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.

Similar to `Content` object, each `ToDo` object have a `Status` object, representing the status of the to-do.
The status of a to-do can be either `done` or `undone`.

When user check/uncheck an existing to-do of specific `Index`, a new `ToDo` is created, with the existing `ToDo`'s `Content` and appropriate new `Status`.

The existing to-do is replaced by the new to-do in the `UniqueToDoList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
<<fig46, Figure 46>> shows how the checkToDo operation works:

<<fig47, Figure 47>> shows how the unCheckToDo operation works:
[[fig47]]
.Sequence Diagram for unCheckToDo.
image::UnCheckToDoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `CheckToDoCommand` and `UnCheckToDoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new method `setStatus(Status newStatus)` in `ToDo`
** Pros: This implementation do not require a new `ToDo` object to be created to replace the existing to-do.
** Cons: This implementation does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

// end::checkToDo[]

// tag::editToDo[]
=== Edit ToDo feature
==== Current implementation

The edit to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `EditToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports modifying Content objects within ToDo objects. EditToDoCommand inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, EditToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.

When user edit an existing to-do of specific `Index`, a new `ToDo` is created, with the new `Content` and a new `Status` of "undone" value.

The existing to-do is replaced by the new to-do in the `UniqueToDoList` and the current state of the address book is saved.
<<fig48, Figure 48>> shows how the editToDo operation works:
[[fig48]]
.Sequence Diagram for EditToDo.
image::EditToDoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `EditToDoCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new method `setContentAndStatus(Content content, Status newStatus)` in `ToDo`
** Pros: This implementation do not require a new `ToDo` object to be created to replace the existing to-do.
** Cons: This implementation does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

// end::editToDo[]

// tag::deleteToDo[]
=== Delete ToDo feature
==== Current implementation

The delete to-dos mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteToDoCommand`, which resides inside `Logic` component. It supports deleting ToDo objects. DeleteToDoCommand inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

Hence, DeleteToDoCommand can be undone using `UndoRedoStack`.

When user delete an existing to-do of specific `Index`, the `UniqueToDoList` within `AddressBook` is updated and stored in the `StorageManager`.

<<fig49, Figure 49>> shows how the deleteToDo operation works:
[[fig49]]
.Sequence Diagram for DeleteToDo.

// end::deleteToDo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the <<fig50, Figure 50>>.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.

==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.

==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
